# GameOfChats
This is simply Let's Build Apps' Firebase Chat Course + I'm planning to improve its architecture with either VIPER or MVVM-P + FlowControls.

I've cleaned up some of the codes along the way, introducing some code separations and PromiseKit usage for multiple async calls.

This project is still ongoing, so feel free to critique/raise issues/PR on aspects that needs improvements.
